# MUT - Murray's Unsupported Tools

A place to share my noodlings and helper tools. Most are orientated around my work unpacking and vsiualising system performance data. Just a big bag to store my stuff. If you find them useful, great!

As the title says. These tools are not supported, but suggestions, tips, fixes!, and any other comments welcome. I am a hacker, in the sense "...a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship...". 

>As Abraham Maslow said in 1966, "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."

My current favorite tool for everything is Python, so you will see a lot of that here -- as I learn Python -- so code is bound to be not best practice.
